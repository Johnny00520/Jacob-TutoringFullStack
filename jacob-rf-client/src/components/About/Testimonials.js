                                <p>"Jacob taught my 10 year old son and 8 year old daughter in reading, writing, math, and general homework help. 
                                He really impressed me because not only did both of my children receive improved remarks from their teachers and school grade reports, but my children also enjoyed his lessons and spending time with him. I think this made the biggest difference compared to other tutors we have tried."

                                <p>I had the pleasure to be Jacob's student at ELS Language Center in Denver, CO. It was an amazing experience to be in his class. His knowledge to teach was mind-blowing. I've learned a lot from him and I've improved my English skills. His way of teaching made me realize I could easily learn English. He's not only a great teacher, but also a great person. I'm very thankful that I got to know him and was his student.</p>

                                <p>"Two years ago I studied English with teacher Jacob. It was an amazing experience, he helped me to improve my English skills. I remembered when I started my English classes with him I was not too good at English, but my classes with him were so great that even though I didn’t know English, I could understand what he meant. I’m really grateful for him because now I have good English. Also teacher Jacob always worried about his students about if they understand everything, and he all the time is trying to make his classes very interesting and proficient."</p>

                                <p>"I met Mr. Withrow back in 2015 when I started my English course. He was my teacher in reading and writing classes. He was the best at it. Without him, I would not have made it and be the best in academic writing. I did not know that until I started my higher education and all my teachers were admiring the way I write as if English were my first language. I remember him saying “you always write simple sentences to be on the safe side but you can write much more complex sentences and advance your writing”. That, he motivated me and I have made through college with good writing skills. All thanks to Jacob and his way of insisting on making students better their language skills."</p>

                                <p>"Teacher Jacob was my teacher during my stay in Denver, CO. and I have to say that even though at first it was hard for me because of my low knowledge in the English language, he made it easier for me. He is the kind of teacher that everyone likes, he has this sense of humor that makes his classes really fun but he is also the kind of teacher who challenges you. He made me do some presentations with slides and in front of my class, and I always received feedback from him so I could improve the next time. He answered and resolved every doubt that I had and if I didn’t understand a word, he explained it with some examples until I got it. He helped me a lot in the most important parts of my English, speaking and writing. Even outside of class he would always help us if we had trouble with something. Something that I liked about his classes is that at first he talked to us in an easier way, not so fast and with simple words and as we were getting better he changed the way he talked to us, a little bit faster and using more vocabulary. That made me feel that I was really improving. He gets along with the students so well and when I left the class I always felt that I learned something new. So what else can I say, he was part of the teachers that everyone wanted to have.</p>

                                <p>"I am a international student from South Korea completing a graduate degree at University of Colorado Denver. Mr. Jacob taught my daughter (11 year old) and boy (7 year old) English language and school help who are staying in Denver with me. They both go to American elementary school in Denver. Mr. Jacob helped improve their English skills so they do excellent in school, and they talk and write like native speakers now. Their English is much better than mine now, but they do not know English very much when they arrived. My children also enjoy Mr. Jacob tutoring very much because he makes it fun for them. Mr. Jacob also helped me a little with my research paper when he had some free time. I'm am very happy with his service, I am just sad that he moved away from Denver."</p>

                                <p>"Mr. Withrow was one of my best teachers I have ever met in my life. He specifically taught me technical English writing skills and reading techniques for the iBT TOEFL exam when I was a student at ELS. Because I learned so many skills from him within 7 months, my score jumped up rapidly and I entered the university which I really wanted to attend. 
Not only is he a great English teacher, but he is also a great mentor because he has a lot of knowledge of all educational fields. If you do not know something, he always has an answer for you!! </p>
